## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is built using a modern, robust technology stack, emphasizing clean code, scalability, and maintainability.

### Backend & Core

* **Language:** Java 17
* **Framework:** Spring Boot 3
* **Data Persistence:** Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Database Migrations:** Liquibase
* **API:** RESTful API with Spring Web MVC
* **Authentication & Authorization:** Spring Security with JWT

### Telegram Bot

* **Library:** [TelegramBots](https://github.com/rubenlagus/TelegramBots)
* **Communication:** Webhook-based for high performance and scalability.

### Other Key Technologies

* **Caching:** Spring Cache with Redis for performance optimization.
* **File Storage:** MinIO (S3-compatible object storage) for handling file uploads like profile pictures.
* **API Documentation:** Springdoc OpenAPI (Swagger UI) for interactive API documentation.
* **Code Generation:** Lombok & MapStruct to reduce boilerplate code.
* **Scheduling:** `cron-utils` for parsing and managing recurring tasks.

### Architectural Highlights

* **Modular Design:** The application is logically separated into `site` (REST API) and `telegram` (Bot Logic) modules.
* **Database First with Migrations:** The database schema is managed entirely through Liquibase, ensuring consistency
  across all environments.
* **Soft Deletion:** Implemented across most entities to prevent accidental data loss and maintain data integrity.
* **Internationalization (i18n):** The bot is designed to be multi-lingual from the ground up.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* JDK 17 or higher
* Maven 3.6+
* PostgreSQL 14+
* An active Redis instance
* An active MinIO instance

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdulbositAbdurahimovDeveloper/KUNDALIK.git
   cd KUNDALIK
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with your database credentials, JWT secret, MinIO keys,
   and Telegram Bot token. See `.env.example` for a template.

3. **Setup the Database:**
    * Create a new PostgreSQL database.
    * Update the `spring.datasource.*` properties in `application.yaml` or your `.env` file.

4. **Run the application:**
   The application uses `spring-dotenv` to load environment variables. You can run it directly from your IDE or using
   Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
   Liquibase will automatically create and migrate the database schema on the first startup.

5. **Access the API:**
    * **Swagger UI:** `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`
